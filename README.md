# 🎬 Popflix

**Popflix** is a social movie recommendation app built with **React Native (Expo)**.  
It’s where friends share what they’ve watched, write honest mini-reviews, and discover new films through genuine recommendations — not algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Popflix connects users through movies — letting them:
- Post what they’ve watched.
- Write quick, authentic reviews.
- Discover films through their friends’ activity feed.

Built using:
- **React Native (Expo)**
- **Tamagui + Tailwind CSS**
- **Firebase (for backend & auth)**
- **Expo Router (for navigation)**

---

## 🧭 Project Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/popflix.git
cd popflix
npm install
````

### 2️⃣ Run in Development

```bash
npx expo start
```

---

## 🧩 Common Issues & Fixes

Below are **developer findings (FIND)** and their **solutions (FIX)** to avoid wasting time on repetitive errors.

---

### 🧠 FIND 101 → `npx tailwindcss init` Not Working

#### ❌ Problem

When using **Tailwind CSS v4+**, the following command fails:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

**Error:**

```
npm ERR! could not determine executable to run
```

#### 💡 Reason

> Tailwind CSS v4+ no longer includes the CLI binary in `node_modules/.bin`.
> This means `npx tailwindcss init` only works in **Tailwind v3**.

#### ✅ FIX

##### Option 1: Downgrade to Tailwind v3

```bash
# Clean your project (recommended)
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json

# Install Tailwind v3
npm install -D tailwindcss@3 postcss autoprefixer

# Now this works again:
npx tailwindcss init
```

##### Option 2: Use Tailwind v4+ Installation Method

If you prefer the latest version, skip the init command and follow the **v4 build process** using PostCSS, Vite, or Webpack.

> 📝 Note: Tailwind v4+ uses a **different build system**, so the CLI workflow has changed.

### 🧠 FIND 102 → Metro Bundler SHA-1 Error

#### ❌ Error

```
Error: Failed to get the SHA-1 for:
.../expo-router/entry.js

Potential causes:
1) The file is not watched. Ensure it is under `projectRoot` or `watchFolders`.
2) Check `blockList` in your metro.config.js.
3) The file may have been deleted — try refreshing your app.
4) Otherwise, this is a Metro bug.
```

#### 💡 Reason

This typically happens when **Metro Bundler** loses file tracking or `expo-router` resides outside the configured watch paths.

#### ✅ FIX

1. **Clear Metro cache**

   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

2. **Ensure watchFolders are correctly set**
   In `metro.config.js`:

   ```js
   const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
   const path = require("path");

   const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

   config.watchFolders = [
     path.resolve(__dirname, "node_modules"),
   ];

   module.exports = config;
   ```

3. **Ensure file exists and paths are valid**

   * Confirm that `expo-router/entry.js` exists in the resolved path.
   * Avoid deleting or moving files during bundling.

4. **Last Resort: Reinstall dependencies**

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

## 🧠 Developer Notes

* Always run **`npx expo start -c`** after updating dependencies.
* Keep **Tailwind and Tamagui** versions compatible with your Expo SDK.
* For React Native builds, prefer **pnpm or npm** (Yarn v4 may cause Metro issues).

Would you like me to **generate the screenshot section placeholders automatically** (like showing “where to add screenshots” with Markdown image blocks and filenames in `/docs/images`), or keep it minimal with just text placeholders?
```
